Personal Responsive Portfolio Website

# Responsive Portfolio Guidelines

This is an example of a personal portfolio website using my personal information to exhibit the template. This particular template utilized Bootstrap to build the layout and provide responsiveness for the client that can be easily customized. The template includes: an area to display a personal image and professional summary, a portfolio page with mutliple links that display image and text, and a contact page that allows visitors to provide name, e-mail, and a brief message. Below is an overview of the template components provided to the end-user as their source code.

All information provided in the site relates to my professional work and is provided only to illustrate the components of the site.

# Acceptance Criteria Requirements:

Functional, deployed application includes the following:

* GitHub repository with README describing the project (for future developer review).

* Navbar is consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
